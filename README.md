This app utilizes React to interact with the Spotify API to enable users to search the Spotify catalog, 
choose songs for a playlist, and save the playlist to their Spotify account.

To execute on your local machine, run `npm install` to install dependencies, then `npm start` to start 
the React development environment.  A browser window will appear with the application loaded.
